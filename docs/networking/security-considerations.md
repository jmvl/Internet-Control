# Security Considerations - VLAN Management Interface Isolation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security considerations for implementing VLAN-based management interface isolation. It covers security principles, threat models, risk mitigation strategies, and ongoing security practices required to maintain effective isolation while preserving operational functionality.

## Security Objectives

### Primary Security Goals
1. **Management Interface Protection**: Isolate administrative interfaces from user network segments
2. **Lateral Movement Prevention**: Limit attack propagation between network segments
3. **Access Control Granularity**: Implement principle of least privilege across network services
4. **Audit and Accountability**: Provide comprehensive logging and monitoring of access attempts
5. **Operational Continuity**: Maintain security without disrupting legitimate user activities

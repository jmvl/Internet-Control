# Infrastructure Coverage Summary - Complete Ansible Management

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive infrastructure analysis and expansion of Ansible automation coverage completed on 2025-09-26. The automation framework was expanded from 4 systems to 6 systems, adding critical storage and email infrastructure management.

## Infrastructure Analysis Results

### Before (Limited Coverage)
**4 Systems Under Management**:
- ✅ Proxmox Host (pve2) - Basic maintenance
- ✅ Docker VM (PCT-111) - Docker cleanup
- ✅ Confluence (PCT-100) - System updates
- ✅ JIRA (PCT-102) - System updates

**Critical Gaps Identified**:
- ❌ OMV Storage Server - 27TB storage, 20+ containers unmanaged
- ❌ Mail Server - Business-critical email services unmanaged
- ❌ Additional containers - No SSH access configured
- ❌ Network infrastructure - API integration needed

### After (Complete Coverage)
**6 Systems Under Full Management**:
- ✅ **Proxmox Host** (pve2) - Enhanced comprehensive maintenance
- ✅ **Docker VM** (PCT-111) - Full Docker platform management
- ✅ **OMV Storage Server** (192.168.1.9) - ✨ **NEW** - Complete storage and container management
- ✅ **Mail Server** (PCT-130) - ✨ **NEW** - Email services maintenance
- ✅ **Confluence** (PCT-100) - Wiki system updates
- ✅ **JIRA** (PCT-102) - Issue tracking system updates

## Complete Automation Framework

### Coordinated Maintenance Schedule
```
DAILY MAINTENANCE (1:00-3:00 AM):
1:00 AM  - Proxmox host health checks and cleanup
2:00 AM  - Docker VM log cleanup
2:30 AM  - OMV storage health monitoring

WEEKLY MAINTENANCE (Sunday 2:30-4:00 AM):
2:30 AM  - Proxmox full system maintenance
3:00 AM  - Docker VM comprehensive maintenance
3:30 AM  - OMV storage full maintenance (BTRFS scrubs)
4:00 AM  - Mail server maintenance (queue/SSL checks)

MONTHLY MAINTENANCE (First Sunday):
1:30 AM  - Proxmox comprehensive maintenance
4:30 AM  - OMV comprehensive storage maintenance
```

### Resource Coverage
- **Total Systems**: 6 fully managed systems
- **Container Management**: 40+ Docker containers across 2 hosts
- **Storage Management**: 27TB across multiple filesystem types
- **Service Coverage**: Web, email, storage, virtualization platforms
- **Security Updates**: Automated across all critical infrastructure

## Implementation Details

### New Playbooks Created
1. **`omv-storage-maintenance.yml`** - OpenMediaVault comprehensive maintenance
2. **`mail-server-maintenance.yml`** - Mail server services and security

### Updated Infrastructure
- **Ansible Inventory**: Expanded to include storage and mail servers
- **SSH Access**: Configured for new systems
- **Cron Scheduling**: Coordinated to prevent maintenance conflicts
- **Log Management**: Centralized monitoring across all systems

### Monitoring and Results
- **Central Dashboard**: `/usr/local/bin/check-ansible-status.sh`
- **Log Locations**: Distributed across managed systems
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live log tailing capabilities
- **Health Verification**: Connectivity and service status checks

## Operational Impact

### Before vs After Comparison

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Managed Systems** | 4 | 6 | +50% coverage |
| **Storage Under Management** | 0TB | 27TB | Complete storage automation |
| **Container Management** | 20 containers | 40+ containers | Doubled container coverage |
| **Email Services** | Manual | Automated | Business continuity assured |
| **Maintenance Windows** | 3 daily, 3 weekly | 3 daily, 4 weekly | Optimized scheduling |
| **Log Monitoring** | Limited | Comprehensive | Full infrastructure visibility |

### Risk Mitigation Achieved
- **Storage Failures**: BTRFS scrubs detect corruption early
- **Email Downtime**: Queue management prevents delivery failures
- **Container Issues**: Health monitoring across all Docker hosts

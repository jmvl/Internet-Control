# PCT 101 Container Restoration - 2026-02-03

## Overview
Successfully restored PCT 101 (OpenClaw Gateway Service) from backup after the container became corrupted.

## Restoration Process

### Step 1: Assessment
- Identified PCT 101 as the OpenClaw Gateway Service container
- Located backups in `/mnt/usb-backup/dump/`
- Found two backup files:
  - `vzdump-lxc-101-2026_01_31-04_00_00.tar.zst` (3.43 GB)
  - `vzdump-lxc-101-2026_02_01-04_00_08.tar.zst` (3.44 GB) - Used for restore

### Step 2: Backup Selection
- Chose the 2026-02-01 backup as it was the most recent successful backup
- Verified the backup was complete (9.0GiB written, 3.20GB archive size)

### Step 3: Container Destruction
- Stopped PCT 101 container: `pct stop 101`
- Destroyed existing container: `pct destroy 101 --purge`
- Backed up existing configuration: `cp /etc/pve/nodes/pve2/lxc/101.conf /etc/pve/nodes/pve2/lxc/101.conf.pre-restore.bak`

### Step 4: Restoration
- Executed restore command: `pct restore 101 /mnt/usb-backup/dump/vzdump-lxc-101-2026_02_01-04_00_08.tar.zst --storage ssd-4tb`
- Restoration process formatted and extracted 9.0GB of data
- Container was automatically stopped during restoration

### Step 5: Verification
- Started container: `pct start 101`
- Verified container status: `running`
- Confirmed hostname: `openclaw`
- Verified network interface: eth0 with IP 192.168.1.151
- Confirmed services running:
  - openclaw-gateway (PID 290) - Main gateway process
  - Postfix mail server (PIDs 443, 444, 445)
- Tested SSH connectivity: Successful

## Result
✅ **RESTORATION SUCCESSFUL**
- PCT 101 (OpenClaw Gateway Service) is fully operational
- All services are running correctly
- Network connectivity restored
- SSH access functional
- Container restored to its pre-corruption state from February 1st backup
